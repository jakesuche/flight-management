## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-management.git
   cd flight-management
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   \`\`\`
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url_here
   \`\`\`

4. Run the development server:
   \`\`\`
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Component Design Patterns

1. **Atomic Design**: We've structured our components following the Atomic Design methodology, with atoms (basic UI components), molecules (groups of atoms), and organisms (groups of molecules and/or atoms).

2. **Container/Presentational Pattern**: We separate the logic and presentation concerns. Container components (like pages) handle data fetching and state management, while presentational components focus on rendering UI.

3. **Composition**: We use composition to build complex components from simpler ones, promoting reusability and maintainability.

4. **Hooks**: We extensively use React Hooks for state management and side effects. Custom hooks (`use-api.ts`, `use-form.ts`) encapsulate reusable logic.

5. **Context API**: We use React's Context API for global state management, particularly for user authentication (`auth-context.tsx`).

6. **Render Props**: Some components use the render props pattern to share code between components.

## API Integration

We use a custom `api` object (`lib/api.ts`) to interact with the backend. This object provides methods for all necessary API calls, handling authentication and request/response processing.

## Testing

1. **Unit Testing**: We use Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests. Run unit tests with:
   \`\`\`
   npm run test
   \`\`\`

2. **End-to-End Testing**: We use Cypress for E2E tests. Run E2E tests with:
   \`\`\`
   npm run test:e2e
   \`\`\`

## Deployment

This project is set up to be easily deployed on Vercel. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on every push to the main branch.

For other platforms, make sure to build the project first:

\`\`\`
npm run build
\`\`\`

Then, you can start the production server:

\`\`\`
npm start
\`\`\`
